I have converted my a2 app to use react and connect to the tester account in the db. This account is username test password test for https://a3-kiara-munz.glitch.me. It does not use editing or cookies from a3, but still has some updating code in there.
I believe Recact was a better framework for webapops than what I used before, but converting between the two still hit some snags. Mostly headers, passing data, and passing reference objects tripped me up. These things were slightly harder to understand than the normal things I had to debug. Otherwise, the Component based programming is very organizable and I appreciate it!
